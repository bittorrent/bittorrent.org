<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This BEP provides a boilerplate or sample template for creating your
own reStructuredText BEPs.  In conjunction with the content guidelines
in BEP 1 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#bep-1" id="id1">[1]</a>, this should make it easy for you to conform your own
BEPs to the format outlined below.</p>
<p>Note: if you are reading this BEP via the web, you should first grab
the text (reStructuredText) source of this BEP in order to complete
the steps below.  <strong>DO NOT USE THE HTML FILE AS YOUR TEMPLATE!</strong></p>
<p>To get the source this (or any) BEP, look at the top of the HTML page
and click on the date &amp; time on the &quot;Last-Modified&quot; line.  It is a
link to the source text in the BitTorrent.org subversion repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rationale">
<h1>Rationale</h1>
<p>BEP submissions come in a wide variety of forms, not all adhering
to the format guidelines set forth below.  Use this template, in
conjunction with the format guidelines below, to ensure that your
BEP submission won't get automatically rejected because of form.</p>
<p>ReStructuredText is offered as an alternative to plaintext BEPs, to
allow BEP authors more functionality and expressivity, while
maintaining easy readability in the source text.  The processed HTML
form makes the functionality accessible to readers: live hyperlinks,
styled text, tables, images, and automatic tables of contents, among
other advantages.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="how-to-use-this-template">
<h1>How to Use This Template</h1>
<p>To use this template you must first decide whether your BEP is going
to be an Informational or Standards Track BEP.  Most BEPs are
Standards Track because they propose a new feature for the BitTorrent
system including the BitTorrent suite of protocols.  When in doubt,
read BEP 1 for details or contact the BEP editors
&lt;<a class="reference external" href="mailto:editor&#37;&#52;&#48;bittorrent&#46;org">editor<span>&#64;</span>bittorrent<span>&#46;</span>org</a>&gt;.</p>
<p>Once you've decided which type of BEP yours is going to be, follow the
directions below.</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Make a copy of this file (<tt class="docutils literal">.rst</tt> file, <strong>not</strong> HTML!)  and perform
the following edits.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Replace the &quot;BEP: 2&quot; header with &quot;BEP: XXX&quot; since you don't yet have
a BEP number assignment.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Change the Title header to the title of your BEP.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Leave the Version and Last-Modified headers alone; we'll take care
of those when we check your BEP into BitTorrent's Subversion repository.
These headers consist of keywords (&quot;Revision&quot; and &quot;Date&quot; enclosed in
&quot;$&quot;-signs) which are automatically expanded by the repository.
Please do not edit the expanded date or revision text.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Change the Author header to include your name, and optionally your
email address.  Be sure to follow the format carefully: your name
must appear first, and it must not be contained in parentheses.
Your email address may appear second (or it can be omitted) and if
it appears, it must appear in angle brackets.  It is okay to
obfuscate your email address.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If there is a mailing list for discussion of your new feature, add a
Discussions-To header right after the Author header.  You should not
add a Discussions-To header if the mailing list to be used is
<a class="reference external" href="mailto:bittorrent-list&#37;&#52;&#48;bittorrent&#46;org">bittorrent-list<span>&#64;</span>bittorrent<span>&#46;</span>org</a>, or if discussions should be sent to
you directly.  Most Informational BEPs don't have a Discussions-To
header.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Change the Status header to &quot;Draft&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">For Standards Track BEPs, change the Type header to &quot;Standards
Track&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">For Informational BEPs, change the Type header to &quot;Informational&quot;.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">For Standards Track BEPs, if your feature depends on the acceptance
of some other currently in-development BEP, add a Requires header
right after the Type header.  The value should be the BEP number of
the BEP yours depends on.  Don't add this header if your dependent
feature is described in a Final BEP.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Change the Created header to today's date.  Be sure to follow the
format carefully: it must be in <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">dd-mmm-yyyy</span></tt> format, where the
<tt class="docutils literal">mmm</tt> is the 3 English letter month abbreviation, i.e. one of Jan,
Feb, Mar, Apr, May, Jun, Jul, Aug, Sep, Oct, Nov, Dec.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Leave Post-History alone for now; you'll add dates to this header
each time you post your BEP to <a class="reference external" href="mailto:bittorrent-list&#37;&#52;&#48;bittorrent&#46;org">bittorrent-list<span>&#64;</span>bittorrent<span>&#46;</span>org</a>.  If
you posted your BEP to the lists on August 14, 2001 and September 3,
2001, the Post-History header would look like:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Post-History: 14-Aug-2001, 03-Sept-2001
</pre>
<p>You must manually add new dates and check them in.  If you don't
have check-in privileges, send your changes to the BEP editors.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Add a Replaces header if your BEP obsoletes an earlier BEP.  The
value of this header is the number of the BEP that your new BEP is
replacing.  Only add this header if the older BEP is in &quot;final&quot;
form, i.e. is either Accepted, Final, or Rejected.  You aren't
replacing an older open BEP if you're submitting a competing idea.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Now write your Abstract, Rationale, and other content for your BEP,
replacing all this gobbledygook with your own text. Be sure to
adhere to the format guidelines below, specifically on the
prohibition of tab characters and the indentation requirements.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Update your References and Copyright section.  Usually you'll place
your BEP into the public domain, in which case just leave the
Copyright section alone.  Alternatively, you can use the <a class="reference external" href="http://www.opencontent.org/openpub/">Open
Publication License</a>, but public domain is still strongly
preferred.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Leave the Emacs stanza at the end of this file alone, including the
formfeed character (&quot;^L&quot;, or <tt class="docutils literal">\f</tt>).</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Send your BEP submission to the BEP editors at <a class="reference external" href="mailto:editor&#37;&#52;&#48;bittorrent&#46;org">editor<span>&#64;</span>bittorrent<span>&#46;</span>org</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="restructuredtext-bep-formatting-requirements">
<h1>ReStructuredText BEP Formatting Requirements</h1>
<p>The following is a BEP-specific summary of reStructuredText syntax.
For the sake of simplicity and brevity, much detail is omitted.  For
more detail, see <a class="reference internal" href="#resources">Resources</a> below.  <a class="reference internal" href="#literal-blocks">Literal blocks</a> (in which no
markup processing is done) are used for examples throughout, to
illustrate the plaintext markup.</p>
<div class="section" id="general">
<h2>General</h2>
<p>You must adhere to the Emacs convention of adding two spaces at the
end of every sentence.</p>
<p>Tab characters must never appear in the document at all.  A BEP should
include the standard Emacs stanza included by example at the bottom of
this BEP.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="section-headings">
<h2>Section Headings</h2>
<p>BEP headings must begin in column zero and the initial letter of each
word must be capitalized as in book titles.  Acronyms should be in all
capitals.  Section titles must be adorned with an underline, a single
repeated punctuation character, which begins in column zero and must
extend at least as far as the right edge of the title text (4
characters minimum).  First-level section titles are underlined with
&quot;=&quot; (equals signs), second-level section titles with &quot;-&quot; (hyphens),
and third-level section titles with &quot;'&quot; (single quotes or
apostrophes).  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
First-Level Title
=================

Second-Level Title
------------------

Third-Level Title
'''''''''''''''''
</pre>
<p>If there are more than three levels of sections in your BEP, you may
insert overline/underline-adorned titles for the first and second
levels as follows:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
============================
First-Level Title (optional)
============================

-----------------------------
Second-Level Title (optional)
-----------------------------

Third-Level Title
=================

Fourth-Level Title
------------------

Fifth-Level Title
'''''''''''''''''
</pre>
<p>You shouldn't have more than five levels of sections in your BEP.  If
you do, you should consider rewriting it.</p>
<p>You must use two blank lines between the last line of a section's body
and the next section heading.  If a subsection heading immediately
follows a section heading, a single blank line in-between is
sufficient.</p>
<p>The body of each section is not normally indented, although some
constructs do use indentation, as described below.  Blank lines are
used to separate constructs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="paragraphs">
<h2>Paragraphs</h2>
<p>Paragraphs are left-aligned text blocks separated by blank lines.
Paragraphs are not indented unless they are part of an indented
construct (such as a block quote or a list item).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="inline-markup">
<h2>Inline Markup</h2>
<p>Portions of text within paragraphs and other text blocks may be
styled.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Text may be marked as *emphasized* (single asterisk markup,
typically shown in italics) or **strongly emphasized** (double
asterisks, typically boldface).  ``Inline literals`` (using double
backquotes) are typically rendered in a monospaced typeface.  No
further markup recognition is done within the double backquotes,
so they're safe for any kind of code snippets.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="block-quotes">
<h2>Block Quotes</h2>
<p>Block quotes consist of indented body elements.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
This is a paragraph.

    This is a block quote.

    A block quote may contain many paragraphs.
</pre>
<p>Block quotes are used to quote extended passages from other sources.
Block quotes may be nested inside other body elements.  Use 4 spaces
per indent level.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="literal-blocks">
<h2>Literal Blocks</h2>
<!-- In the text below, double backquotes are used to denote inline
literals.  "``::``" is written so that the colons will appear in a
monospaced font; the backquotes (``) are markup, not part of the
text.  See "Inline Markup" above.

By the way, this is a comment, described in "Comments" below. -->
<p>Literal blocks are used for code samples or preformatted ASCII art. To
indicate a literal block, preface the indented text block with
&quot;<tt class="docutils literal">::</tt>&quot; (two colons).  The literal block continues until the end of
the indentation.  Indent the text block by 4 spaces.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
This is a typical paragraph.  A literal block follows.

::

    for a in [5,4,3,2,1]:   # this is program code, shown as-is
        print a
    print &quot;it's...&quot;
    # a literal block continues until the indentation ends
</pre>
<p>The paragraph containing only &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">::</tt>&quot; will be completely removed from
the output; no empty paragraph will remain.  &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">::</tt>&quot; is also
recognized at the end of any paragraph.  If immediately preceded by
whitespace, both colons will be removed from the output.  When text
immediately precedes the &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">::</tt>&quot;, <em>one</em> colon will be removed from
the output, leaving only one colon visible (i.e., &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">::</tt>&quot; will be
replaced by &quot;<tt class="docutils literal">:</tt>&quot;).  For example, one colon will remain visible
here:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Paragraph::

    Literal block
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="lists">
<h2>Lists</h2>
<p>Bullet list items begin with one of &quot;-&quot;, &quot;*&quot;, or &quot;+&quot; (hyphen,
asterisk, or plus sign), followed by whitespace and the list item
body.  List item bodies must be left-aligned and indented relative to
the bullet; the text immediately after the bullet determines the
indentation.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
This paragraph is followed by a list.

* This is the first bullet list item.  The blank line above the
  first list item is required; blank lines between list items
  (such as below this paragraph) are optional.

* This is the first paragraph in the second item in the list.

  This is the second paragraph in the second item in the list.
  The blank line above this paragraph is required.  The left edge
  of this paragraph lines up with the paragraph above, both
  indented relative to the bullet.

  - This is a sublist.  The bullet lines up with the left edge of
    the text blocks above.  A sublist is a new list so requires a
    blank line above and below.

* This is the third item of the main list.

This paragraph is not part of the list.
</pre>
<p>Enumerated (numbered) list items are similar, but use an enumerator
instead of a bullet.  Enumerators are numbers (1, 2, 3, ...), letters
(A, B, C, ...; uppercase or lowercase), or Roman numerals (i, ii, iii,
iv, ...; uppercase or lowercase), formatted with a period suffix
(&quot;1.&quot;, &quot;2.&quot;), parentheses (&quot;(1)&quot;, &quot;(2)&quot;), or a right-parenthesis
suffix (&quot;1)&quot;, &quot;2)&quot;).  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
1. As with bullet list items, the left edge of paragraphs must
   align.

2. Each list item may contain multiple paragraphs, sublists, etc.

   This is the second paragraph of the second list item.

   a) Enumerated lists may be nested.
   b) Blank lines may be omitted between list items.
</pre>
<p>Definition lists are written like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
what
    Definition lists associate a term with a definition.

how
    The term is a one-line phrase, and the definition is one
    or more paragraphs or body elements, indented relative to
    the term.
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tables">
<h2>Tables</h2>
<p>Simple tables are easy and compact but you are not required to use
simple tables:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
=====  =====  =======
  A      B    A and B
=====  =====  =======
False  False  False
True   False  False
False  True   False
True   True   True
=====  =====  =======
</pre>
<p>There must be at least two columns in a table (to differentiate from
section titles).  Column spans use underlines of hyphens (&quot;Inputs&quot;
spans the first two columns):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
=====  =====  ======
   Inputs     Output
------------  ------
  A      B    A or B
=====  =====  ======
False  False  False
True   False  True
False  True   True
True   True   True
=====  =====  ======
</pre>
<p>Text in a first-column cell starts a new row.  No text in the first
column indicates a continuation line; the rest of the cells may
consist of multiple lines.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
=====  =========================
col 1  col 2
=====  =========================
1      Second column of row 1.
2      Second column of row 2.
       Second line of paragraph.
3      - Second column of row 3.

       - Second item in bullet
         list (row 3, column 2).
=====  =========================
</pre>
</div>
<div class="section" id="hyperlinks">
<h2>Hyperlinks</h2>
<p>When referencing an external web page in the body of a BEP, you should
include the title of the page in the text, with either an inline
hyperlink reference to the URL or a footnote reference (see
<a class="reference internal" href="#footnotes">Footnotes</a> below).  Do not include the URL in the body text of the
BEP.</p>
<p>Hyperlink references use backquotes and a trailing underscore to mark
up the reference text; backquotes are optional if the reference text
is a single word.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
In this paragraph, we refer to the `BitTorrent web site`_.
</pre>
<p>An explicit target provides the URL.  Put targets in a References
section at the end of the BEP, or immediately after the reference.
Hyperlink targets begin with two periods and a space (the &quot;explicit
markup start&quot;), followed by a leading underscore, the reference text,
a colon, and the URL (absolute or relative):</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. _BitTorrent web site: http://www.bittorrent.org/
</pre>
<p>The reference text and the target text must match (although the match
is case-insensitive and ignores differences in whitespace).  Note that
the underscore trails the reference text but precedes the target text.
If you think of the underscore as a right-pointing arrow, it points
<em>away</em> from the reference and <em>toward</em> the target.</p>
<p>The same mechanism can be used for internal references.  Every unique
section title implicitly defines an internal hyperlink target.  We can
make a link to the Abstract section like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Here is a hyperlink reference to the `Abstract`_ section.  The
backquotes are optional since the reference text is a single word;
we can also just write: Abstract_.
</pre>
<p>Footnotes containing the URLs from external targets will be generated
automatically at the end of the References section of the BEP, along
with footnote references linking the reference text to the footnotes.</p>
<p>Text of the form &quot;BEP x&quot; or &quot;RFC x&quot; (where &quot;x&quot; is a number) will be
linked automatically to the appropriate URLs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="footnotes">
<h2>Footnotes</h2>
<p>Footnote references consist of a left square bracket, a number, a
right square bracket, and a trailing underscore:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
This sentence ends with a footnote reference [1]_.
</pre>
<p>Whitespace must precede the footnote reference.  Leave a space between
the footnote reference and the preceding word.</p>
<p>When referring to another BEP, include the BEP number in the body
text, such as &quot;BEP 1&quot;.  The title may optionally appear.  Add a
footnote reference following the title.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Refer to BEP 1 [2]_ for more information.
</pre>
<p>Add a footnote that includes the BEP's title and author.  It may
optionally include the explicit URL on a separate line, but only in
the References section.  Footnotes begin with &quot;.. &quot; (the explicit
markup start), followed by the footnote marker (no underscores),
followed by the footnote body.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
References
==========

.. [2] BEP 1, &quot;BEP Purpose and Guidelines&quot;, Harrison
   (http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_0001.html)
</pre>
<p>If you decide to provide an explicit URL for a BEP, please use this as
the URL template:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep_xxxx
</pre>
<p>BEP numbers in URLs must be padded with zeros from the left, so as to
be exactly 4 characters wide, however BEP numbers in the text are
never padded.</p>
<p>During the course of developing your BEP, you may have to add, remove,
and rearrange footnote references, possibly resulting in mismatched
references, obsolete footnotes, and confusion.  Auto-numbered
footnotes allow more freedom.  Instead of a number, use a label of the
form &quot;#word&quot;, where &quot;word&quot; is a mnemonic consisting of alphanumerics
plus internal hyphens, underscores, and periods (no whitespace or
other characters are allowed).  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
Refer to BEP 1 [#BEP-1]_ for more information.

References
==========

.. [#BEP-1] BEP 1, &quot;BEP Purpose and Guidelines&quot;, Harrison

   http://www.bittorrent.org/beps/bep-0001
</pre>
<p>Footnotes and footnote references will be numbered automatically, and
the numbers will always match.  Once a BEP is finalized, auto-numbered
labels should be replaced by numbers for simplicity.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="images">
<h2>Images</h2>
<p>If your BEP contains a diagram, you may include it in the processed
output using the &quot;image&quot; directive:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. image:: diagram.png
</pre>
<p>Any browser-friendly graphics format is possible: .png, .jpeg, .gif,
.tiff, etc.</p>
<p>Since this image will not be visible to readers of the BEP in source
text form, you should consider including a description or ASCII art
alternative, using a comment (below).</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="comments">
<h2>Comments</h2>
<p>A comment block is an indented block of arbitrary text immediately
following an explicit markup start: two periods and whitespace.  Leave
the &quot;..&quot; on a line by itself to ensure that the comment is not
misinterpreted as another explicit markup construct.  Comments are not
visible in the processed document.  For the benefit of those reading
your BEP in source form, please consider including a descriptions of
or ASCII art alternatives to any images you include.  For example:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
.. image:: dataflow.png

..
   Data flows from the input module, through the &quot;black box&quot;
   module, and finally into (and through) the output module.
</pre>
<p>The Emacs stanza at the bottom of this document is inside a comment.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="escaping-mechanism">
<h2>Escaping Mechanism</h2>
<p>reStructuredText uses backslashes (&quot;<tt class="docutils literal">\</tt>&quot;) to override the special
meaning given to markup characters and get the literal characters
themselves.  To get a literal backslash, use an escaped backslash
(&quot;<tt class="docutils literal">\\</tt>&quot;).  There are two contexts in which backslashes have no
special meaning: <a class="reference internal" href="#literal-blocks">literal blocks</a> and inline literals (see <a class="reference internal" href="#inline-markup">Inline
Markup</a> above).  In these contexts, no markup recognition is done,
and a single backslash represents a literal backslash, without having
to double up.</p>
<p>If you find that you need to use a backslash in your text, consider
using inline literals or a literal block instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="habits-to-avoid">
<h1>Habits to Avoid</h1>
<p>Many programmers who are familiar with TeX often write quotation marks
like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
`single-quoted' or ``double-quoted''
</pre>
<p>Backquotes are significant in reStructuredText, so this practice
should be avoided.  For ordinary text, use ordinary 'single-quotes' or
&quot;double-quotes&quot;.  For inline literal text (see <a class="reference internal" href="#inline-markup">Inline Markup</a>
above), use double-backquotes:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
``literal text: in here, anything goes!``
</pre>

<p>This document was derived heavily from PEP-0012 <a class="footnote-reference" href="#pep-12" id="id6">[2]</a>.  In many places
text was simply copied and modified.  Although the PEP-0012 text
was written by David Goodger and Barry Warsaw, they are not
responsible for its use in the BitTorent Enhancement Process, and
should not be bothered with technical questions specific to BitTorrent
or the BEP process.  Please direct all comments to the BitTorrent
