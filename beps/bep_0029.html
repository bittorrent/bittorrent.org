<h1>uTorrent Transport Protocol</h1>
<div class="section" id="credits">
<h2>credits</h2>
<p>The uTorrent transport protocol was designed by Ludvig Strigeus,
Greg Hazel, Stanislav Shalunov, Arvid Norberg and Bram Cohen.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="rationale">
<h2>rationale</h2>
<p>The motivation for uTP is for BitTorrent clients to not disrupt
internet connections, while still utilizing the unused bandwidth
fully.</p>
<p>The problem is that DSL and cable modems typically have a send
buffer disproportional to their max send rate, which can hold several
seconds worth of packets. BitTorrent traffic is typically background
transfers, and should have lower priority than checking email,
phone calls and browsing the web, but when using regular TCP
connections BitTorrent quickly fills up the send buffer, adding
multiple seconds delay to all interactive traffic.</p>
<p>The fact that BitTorrent uses multiple TCP connections gives it an
unfair advantage when competing with other services for bandwidth,
which exaggerates the effect of BitTorrent filling the upload pipe.
The reason for this is because TCP distributes the available bandwidth
evenly across connections, and the more connections one application
uses, the larger share of the bandwidth it gets.</p>
<p>The traditional solution to this problem is to cap the upload rate
of the BitTorrent client to 80% of the up-link capacity. 80% leaves
some head room for interactive traffic.</p>
<p>The main drawbacks with this solution are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>The user needs to configure his/her BitTorrent client, it won't
work out-of-the-box.</li>
<li>The user needs to know his/her internet connection's upload
capacity. This capacity may change, especially on laptops that
may connect to a large number of different networks.</li>
<li>The headroom of 20% is arbitrary and wastes bandwidth. Whenever
there is no interactive traffic competing with BitTorrent, the
extra 20% are wasted. Whenever there is competing interactive
traffic, it cannot use more than 20% of the capacity.</li>
</ol>
<p>uTP solves this problem by using the modem queue size as a controller
for its send rate. When the queue grows too large, it throttles back.</p>
<p>This lets it utilize the full upload capacity when there is no
competition for it, and it lets it throttle back to virtually nothing
when there is a lot of interactive traffic.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>overview</h2>
<p>This document assumes some knowledge of how TCP and window based
congestion control works.</p>
<p>uTP is a transport protocol layered on top of UDP. As such, it must
(and has the ability to) implement its own congestion control.</p>
<p>The main difference compared to TCP is the delay based congestion
control. See the <a class="reference internal" href="#congestion-control">congestion control</a> section.</p>
<p>Like TCP, uTP uses window based congestion control. Each socket
has a <tt class="docutils literal">max_window</tt> which determines the maximum number of bytes
the socket may have <em>in-flight</em> at any given time. Any packet that
has been sent, but not yet acked, is considered to be in-flight.</p>
<p>The number of bytes in-flight is <tt class="docutils literal">cur_window</tt>.</p>
<p>A socket may only send a packet if <tt class="docutils literal">cur_window</tt> + <tt class="docutils literal">packet_size</tt>
is less than or equal to min(<tt class="docutils literal">max_window</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">wnd_size</tt>).
The packet size may vary, see the <a class="reference internal" href="#packet-sizes">packet sizes</a> section.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">wnd_size</tt> is the advertised window from the other end. It sets
an upper limit on the number of packets in-flight.</p>
<p>An implementation MAY violate the above rule if the <tt class="docutils literal">max_window</tt>
is smaller than the packet size, and it paces the packets so that
the average <tt class="docutils literal">cur_window</tt> is less than or equal to <tt class="docutils literal">max_window</tt>.</p>
<p>Each socket keeps a state for the last delay measurement from the
other endpoint (<tt class="docutils literal">reply_micro</tt>). Whenever a packet is received,
this state is updated by subtracting <tt class="docutils literal">timestamp_microseconds</tt>
from the hosts current time, in microseconds (see <a class="reference internal" href="#header-format">header format</a>).</p>
<p>Every time a packet is sent, the sockets <tt class="docutils literal">reply_micro</tt> value is
put in the <tt class="docutils literal">timestamp_difference_microseconds</tt> field of the packet
header.</p>
<p>Unlike TCP, sequence numbers and ACKs in uTP refers to packets, not
bytes. This means uTP cannot <em>repackage</em> data when resending it.</p>
<p>Each socket keeps a state of the next sequence number to use when
sending a packet, <tt class="docutils literal">seq_nr</tt>. It also keeps a state of the sequence
number that was last received, <tt class="docutils literal">ack_nr</tt>. The oldest unacked packet
is <tt class="docutils literal">seq_nr</tt> - <tt class="docutils literal">cur_window</tt>.</p>

<p>All fields are in network byte order (big endian).</p>
<div class="section" id="version">
<h3>version</h3>
<p>This is the protocol version. The current version is 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="connection-id">
<h3>connection_id</h3>
<p>This is a random, unique, number identifying all the packets that belong to
the same connection. Each socket has one connection ID for sending packets and
a different connection ID for receiving packets. The endpoint initiating the
connection decides which ID to use, and the return path has the same ID + 1.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="timestamp-microseconds">
<h3>timestamp_microseconds</h3>
<p>This is the 'microseconds' parts of the timestamp of when this packet was sent.
This is set using gettimeofday() on posix and QueryPerformanceTimer()
on windows. The higher resolution this timestamp has, the better. The closer
to the actual transmit time it is set, the better.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="timestamp-difference-microseconds">
<h3>timestamp_difference_microseconds</h3>
<p>This is the difference between the local time and the timestamp in the last
received packet, at the time the last packet was received. This is the latest
one-way delay measurement of the link from the remote peer to the local machine.</p>
<p>When a socket is newly opened and doesn't have any delay samples yet, this must
be set to 0.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wnd-size">
<h3>wnd_size</h3>
<p>Advertised receive window. This is 32 bits wide and specified in bytes.</p>
<p>The window size is the number of bytes currently in-flight, i.e. sent but not
acked. The advertised receive window lets the other end cap the window size
if it cannot receive any faster, if its receive buffer is filling up.</p>
<p>When sending packets, this should be set to the number of bytes left in the
socket's receive buffer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="extension">
<h3>extension</h3>
<p>The type of the first extension in a linked list of extension headers. 0 means
no extension.</p>
<p>There is currently one extension:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Selective acks</li>
</ol>
<p>Extensions are linked, just like TCP options. If the extension field is non-zero,
immediately following the uTP header are two bytes:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
0               8               16
+---------------+---------------+
| extension     | len           |
+---------------+---------------+
</pre>
<p>where <tt class="docutils literal">extension</tt> specifies the type of the next extension in the linked list,
0 terminates the list. And <tt class="docutils literal">len</tt> specifies the number of bytes of this extension.
Unknown extensions can be skipped by simply advancing <tt class="docutils literal">len bytes</tt>.</p>
<div class="section" id="selective-ack">
<h4>Selective ACK</h4>
<p>Selective ACK is an extension that can selectively ACK packets non-sequentially.
Its payload is a bitmask of at least 32 bits, in multiples of 32 bits. Each bit
represents one packet in the send window. Bits that are outside of the send window
are ignored. A set bit specifies that packet has been received, a cleared bit
specifies that the packet has not been received. The header looks like this:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
0               8               16
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| extension     | len           | bitmask
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
                                |
+---------------+---------------+
</pre>
<p>Note that the len field of extensions refer to bytes, which in this extension
must be at least 4, and in multiples of 4.</p>
<p>The selective ACK is only sent when at least one sequence number was skipped in
the received stream. The first bit in the mask therefore represents ack_nr + 2.
ack_nr + 1 is assumed to have been dropped or be missing when this packet was sent.
A set bit represents a packet that has been received, a cleared bit represents
a packet that has not yet been received.</p>
<p>The bitmask has reverse byte order. The first byte represents packets [ack_nr + 2,
ack_nr + 2 + 7] in reverse order. The least significant bit in the byte represents
ack_nr + 2, the most significant bit in the byte represents ack_nr + 2 + 7. The
next byte in the mask represents [ack_nr + 2 + 8, ack_nr + 2 + 15] in reverse order,
and so on. The bitmask is not limited to 32 bits but can be of any size.</p>
<p>Here is the layout of a bitmask representing the first 32 packet acks
represented in a selective ACK bitfield:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
0               8               16
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
| 9 8 ...   3 2 | 17   ...   10 | 25   ...   18 | 33   ...   26 |
+---------------+---------------+---------------+---------------+
</pre>
<p>The number in the diagram maps the bit in the bitmask to the offset to add to
<tt class="docutils literal">ack_nr</tt> in order to calculate the sequence number that the bit is ACKing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="type">
<h3>type</h3>
<p>The type field describes the type of packet.</p>
<p>It can be one of:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>ST_DATA = 0</dt>
<dd>regular data packet. Socket is in connected state and has data
to send. An ST_DATA packet always has a data payload.</dd>
<dt>ST_FIN = 1</dt>
<dd>Finalize the connection. This is the last packet. It closes
the connection, similar to TCP FIN flag.
This connection will never have a sequence number greater than
the sequence number in this packet. The socket records this sequence
number as <tt class="docutils literal">eof_pkt</tt>. This lets the socket wait for packets that
might still be missing and arrive out of order even after receiving
the ST_FIN packet.</dd>
<dt>ST_STATE = 2</dt>
<dd>State packet. Used to transmit an ACK with no data. Packets that don't
include any payload do not increase the <tt class="docutils literal">seq_nr</tt>.</dd>
<dt>ST_RESET = 3</dt>
<dd>Terminate connection forcefully. Similar to TCP RST flag. The remote
host does not have any state for this connection. It is stale and should
be terminated.</dd>
<dt>ST_SYN = 4</dt>
<dd><p class="first">Connect SYN. Similar to TCP SYN flag, this packet initiates a connection.
The sequence number is initialized to 1. The connection ID is initialized
to a random number. The syn packet is special, all subsequent packets sent
on this connection (except for re-sends of the ST_SYN) are sent with the
connection ID + 1. The connection ID is what the other end is expected to
use in its responses.</p>
<p class="last">When receiving an ST_SYN, the new socket should be initialized with the
ID in the packet header. The send ID for the socket should be initialized
to the ID + 1. The sequence number for the return channel is initialized
to a random number. The other end expects an ST_STATE packet (only an ACK)
in response.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</div>
<div class="section" id="seq-nr">
<h3>seq_nr</h3>
<p>This is the sequence number of this packet. As opposed to TCP, uTP sequence
numbers are not referring to bytes, but packets. The sequence number tells the
other end in which order packets should be served back to the application layer.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ack-nr">
<h3>ack_nr</h3>
<p>This is the sequence number the sender of the packet last received in the other
direction.</p>

<p>Every packet that is ACKed, either by falling in the range (last_ack_nr, ack_nr]
or by explicitly being acked by a Selective ACK message, should be used to update
an <tt class="docutils literal">rtt</tt> (round trip time) and <tt class="docutils literal">rtt_var</tt> (rtt variance) measurement.
last_ack_nr here is the last ack_nr received on the socket before the current packet,
and ack_nr is the field in the currently received packet.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">rtt</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">rtt_var</tt> is only updated for packets that were sent only once.
This avoids problems with figuring out which packet was acked, the first or the
second one.</p>
<p><tt class="docutils literal">rtt</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">rtt_var</tt> are calculated by the following formula, every time a packet
is ACKed:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
delta = rtt - packet_rtt
rtt_var += (abs(delta) - rtt_var) / 4;
rtt += (packet_rtt - rtt) / 8;
</pre>
<p>The default timeout for packets associated with the socket is also updated every time
<tt class="docutils literal">rtt</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">rtt_var</tt> is updated. It is set to:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
timeout = max(rtt + rtt_var * 4, 500);
</pre>
<p>Where timeout is specified in milliseconds. i.e. the minimum timeout for a packet is
1/2 second.</p>
<p>Every time a socket sends or receives a packet, it updates its timeout counter. If
no packet has arrived within <tt class="docutils literal">timeout</tt> number of milliseconds from the last
timeout counter reset, the socket triggers a timeout. It will set its <tt class="docutils literal">packet_size</tt>
and <tt class="docutils literal">max_window</tt> to the smallest packet size (150 bytes). This allows it to send
one more packet, and this is how the socket gets started again if the window size
goes down to zero.</p>
<p>The initial timeout is set to 1000 milliseconds, and later updated according to
the formula above. For every packet consecutive subsequent packet that times out,
the timeout is doubled.</p>

<div class="section" id="packet-sizes">
<h2>packet sizes</h2>
<p>In order to have as little impact as possible on slow congested links, uTP adjusts
its packet size down to as small as 150 bytes per packet. Using packets that small
has the benefit of not clogging a slow up-link, with long serialization delay.
The cost of using packets that small is that the overhead from the packet headers
become significant. At high rates, large packet sizes are used, at slow rates,
small packet sizes are used.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="congestion-control">
<h2>congestion control</h2>
<p>The overall goal of the uTP congestion control is to use one way buffer delay as the
main congestion measurement, as well as packet loss, like TCP. The point is to avoid
running with full send buffers whenever data is being sent. This is specifically a
problem for DSL/Cable modems, where the send buffer in the modem often has room for
multiple seconds worth of data. The ideal buffer utilization for uTP (or any background
traffic protocol) is to run at 0 bytes buffer utilization. i.e. any other traffic
can at any time send without being obstructed by background traffic clogging up the
send buffer. In practice, the uTP target delay is set to 100 ms. Each socket aims to
never see more than 100 ms delay on the send link. If it does, it will throttle back.</p>
<p>This effectively makes uTP yield to any TCP traffic.</p>
<p>This is achieved by including a high resolution timestamp in every packet that's sent
over uTP, and the receiving end calculates the difference between its own high resolution
timer and the timestamp in the packet it received. This difference is then fed back to the
original sender of the packet (timestamp_difference_microseconds). This value is not meaningful
as an absolute value. The clocks in the machines are most likely not synchronized,
especially not down to microsecond resolution, and the time the packet is in transit is
also included in the difference of these timestamps. However, the value is useful in
comparison to previous values.</p>
<p>Each socket keeps a sliding minimum of the lowest value for the last two minutes. This value
is called <em>base_delay</em>, and is used as a baseline, the minimum delay between the hosts.
When subtracting the base_delay from the timestamp difference in each packet you get a
measurement of the current buffering delay on the socket. This measurement is called <em>our_delay</em>.
It has a lot of noise it it, but is used as the driver to determine whether to increase or
decrease the send window (which controls the send rate).</p>
<p>The <em>CCONTROL_TARGET</em> is the buffering delay that the uTP accepts on the up-link. Currently the
delay target is set to 100 ms. <em>off_target</em> is how far the actual measured delay is from the
target delay (calculated from CCONTROL_TARGET - our_delay).</p>
<p>The window size in the socket structure specifies the number of bytes we may have in flight
(not acked) in total, on the connection. The send rate is directly correlated to this window
size. The more bytes in flight, the faster send rate. In the code, the window size is called
<tt class="docutils literal">max_window</tt>. Its size is controlled, roughly, by the following expression:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
delay_factor = off_target / CCONTROL_TARGET;
window_factor = outstanding_packet / max_window;
scaled_gain = MAX_CWND_INCREASE_PACKETS_PER_RTT * delay_factor * window_factor;
</pre>
<p>Where the first factor scales the <em>off_target</em> to units of target delays.</p>
<p>The scaled_gain is then added to the max_window:</p>
<pre class="literal-block">
max_window += scaled_gain;
</pre>
<p>This will make the window smaller if off_target is greater than 0 and grow the window if
off target is less than 0.</p>
<p>If max_window becomes less than 0, it is set to 0. A window size of zero means that the
socket may not send any packets. In this state, the socket will trigger a timeout and
force the window size to one packet size, and send one packet. See the section on timeouts
for more information.</p>
