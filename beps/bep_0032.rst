Abstract
========

This document describes a set of extensions to the BitTorrent DHT
[#BEP-5]_ to allow operation over IPv6.


Introduction
============

The address exhaustion of the IPv4 Internet, and the coincident deployment
of Network Address Translation (NAT) devices, severely limits the
performance of the BitTorrent protocol by making an increasing number of
peers unreachable.  The simple and efficient solution to this problem is to
deploy BitTorrent over the IPv6 protocol, which does not suffer from
address exhaustion.

A number of extensions (mostly undocumented) to the BitTorrent
protocol have been defined in order to allow it to operate over IPv6.
Unfortunately, these extensions only allow locating IPv6 peers by
using trackers or through peer exchange -- but not from the DHT.  This
document describes the procedures and message formats used in the IPv6
DHT.


Operation
=========

There are two distinct DHTs: the IPv4 DHT, and the IPv6 DHT.

The two DHTs are independent, meaning that no IPv6 data is stored in the
IPv4 DHT, and, conversely, no IPv4 data is stored in the IPv6 DHT.  A node
wishing to participate in both DHTs must maintain two distinct routing
tables, one for IPv4 and one for IPv6.

While this is not strictly necessary, a node should use the same node
id in both tables.  This simplifies implementation and debugging, and
slightly increases efficiency in the case where the two DHTs are
mostly congruent.

Usually, messages only carry data in the address family implied by the
network layer protocol.  In the case of the find_node and get_peers
requests, however, the requestor may optionally request that the reply
should contain IPv4 node information, IPv6 node information, or both.


Single-protocol nodes
---------------------

A single-protocol node (IPv4 or IPv6) only participates in one DHT.  Such
a node does not need to explicitly request data in a given family -- the
data provided by default is exactly what it needs.


Dual-stack nodes
----------------

While conceptually equivalent to a pair of single-protocol nodes,
a dual-stack (IPv4 and IPv6) node can make bootstrap faster and
improve the reliability of the protocol by "leaking" data between the
two DHTs, as described in the following sections.


Bootstrapping
'''''''''''''

A dual-stack node that is bootstrapping its DHT will send find_node
requests in order to populate its routing tables.  In order to accelerate
this process, it should request both IPv4 and IPv6 node information.


Steady-state operation
''''''''''''''''''''''

Once bootstrap is successful, a node should normally only request IPv4
node information from IPv4 nodes, and IPv6 node information from IPv6
nodes.  Requesting node information for both address families in all
requests is unlikely to provide useful information, and hence
increases network traffic with no benefit.

In order to increase the reliability of the DHT after a single-protocol
network outage, however, a node may *ocasionally* send a request for
IPv4 node information to an IPv6 node, or a request for IPv6 node
information to an IPv4 node.


Maximum packet size
-------------------

A node obeying this specification must not send UDP datagrams with
a payload larger than 1024 octets, and must be able to receive UDP
datagrams with a payload of 1024 octets or less.  (In the interest of
robustness, a node should be able to receive datagrams with larger
payloads.)

  **Rationale**: a UDP datagram with a payload of 1024 octets easily
  fits within the IPv6 minimum maximum packet size, which is 1280
  octets [#IPv6]_.  In particular, such a packet will cross a Teredo
  tunnel with no fragmentation.

  In principle, IPv4 nodes might be unable to reassemble packets
  larger than 576 octets [#IPv4]_; in practice, however, due to the
  predominance of Ethernet networks, all IPv4 nodes are able to
  reassemble packets up to 1500 octets.


Source address selection
------------------------

The IPv6 DHT should use a socket bound to one of the host's global
unicast IPv6 addresses rather than the "unspecified address" (::/128).
When selecting to which address to bind, Teredo addresses (addresses
in 2001:0000::/32) should be avoided if other global unicast addresses
are available.

  **Rationale**: The DHT relies on the publicly visible IP address of
  each node to remain constant.  Since multi-homing is common in IPv6,
  it is particularly important to bind the IPv6 socket to a well-defined
  address.

  While Teredo traffic can, in principle, be more efficient than
  native traffic, especially when speaking to other Teredo hosts,
  experience shows that Teredo routing tends to be brittle; hence,
  Teredo addresses should be avoided whenever possible.

  The same issues apply to multi-homed IPv4 hosts.  However, in IPv4
  multi-homing is not as common as in IPv6, and in the presence of NAT
  the issues are somewhat more complicated, so this specification
  refrains from making any recommendations about binding of IPv4
  sockets.


Changes to the BitTorrent protocol
==================================

The PORT message, as defined in BEP-5, is extended to work over both
IPv4 and IPv6.  The information provided by the PORT message only
applies to the address it was sent from; this implies that a PORT
message sent over IPv4 only advertises participation in the IPv4 DHT,
and a PORT message sent over IPv6 only advertises participation in the
IPv6 DHT.

Multihomed hosts should take care to only send PORT messages over
connections established from the address on which they participate in
the DHT.

  **Rationale**: in the presence of the LTEP extension negotiation
  protocol [#BEP-10]_, which advertises a peer's addresses across
  address families, it would in principle be possible to use the PORT
  message for both address families.  However, since an implementation
  need not participate in both DHTs, nor use the same port in both
  DHTs, this specification leaves the role of bridging the two DHTs to
  the 'find_node' message (see below).


Changes and extensions to existing messages
===========================================

Changes to existing parameters
------------------------------

values
''''''

In a reply sent over IPv4, the "values" parameter contains a list of
strings, each of which contains compact format IPv4 contact
information for a single peer.

In a reply sent over IPv6, "values" contains a list of strings, each
of which contains compact format IPv6 contact information for a single
peer.

Implementations of this specification must be able to properly parse
hybrid "values" lists -- lists containing an arbitrary mixture of
6-octet IPv4 values and 18-octet IPv6 values.  However, implementations
should not send such hybrid lists, and must not send hybrid lists in
a reply to an IPv4 request that doesn't contain a "want" parameter.

  **Rationale**: a request sent over IPv4 with no "want" parameter
  could originate from a node that implements plain BEP-5, and which
  might therefore be unable to parse a hybrid list.


New parameters
--------------

nodes6
''''''

The "nodes6" parameter is analogous to the "nodes" parameter: when
present, it carries a string containing the compact IPv6 node
information for the 8 closest good nodes in the sending node's IPv6
routing table.  This parameter is allowed in replies to the find_node
and get_peers messages (see below).


want
''''

The "want" parameter is allowed in the find_node and get_peers requests,
and governs the presence or absence of the "nodes" and "nodes6" parameters
in the requested reply.  Its value is a list of one or more strings, which
may include

  * "n4": the node requests the presence of a "nodes" key;

  * "n6": the node requests the presence of a "nodes6" key.

For future extensibility, other strings may be present in the list,
and must be silently ignored on reception.

   **Rationale**: the "want" parameter is not intended to carry random
   sundry flags, which can simply be included in the top-level
   dictionary of the message.  Extending the "want" parameter without
   good reason is not recommended.


Changes to message semantics
----------------------------

find_node and get_peers
''''''''''''''''''''''''

A node sending a find_node or get_peers request may include a "want"
parameter containing one or both of the strings "n4" or "n6".  A node
replying to a find_node or get_peers request that includes a "want"
parameter should include a "nodes" parameter if the request's "want"
parameter contained the string "n4", and should include a "nodes6"
parameter if the request's "want" parameter contained the string "n6".

In the absence of a "want" parameter, the reply should include "nodes"
if the request was sent over IPv4, and should include "nodes6" if the
request was sent over IPv6.

  **Rationale**: this is an incompatible change to the protocol
  defined in BEP-5, which specifies that "nodes" and "values" are
  mutually exclusive.  However, this change makes the DHT more
  reliable, and has been deployed by most implementations with no
  negative effects.

When a node receives a get_peers request and it has peer contact
information for the matching address family and info-hash, it should
additionally include a "values" parameter containing a list of 6-octet
strings if the request was sent over IPv4, and a list of 18-octet
strings if the request was sent over IPv6.

A reply sent over IPv4 should not contain 18-octet IPv6 contact
information, and a reply sent over IPv6 should not contain 6-octet
IPv4 contact information.  In other words, the "want" parameter only
governs the presence of the "nodes" and "nodes6" parameters, not the
interpretation of "values".

  **Rationale**: if the requesting node is a single-stack node, it has
  no interest in values of the other address family.  If the
  requesting node is a dual-stack node, then it must perform the two
  announces in parallel; providing both sets of data in both sets of
  replies merely increases the amount of traffic without giving any
  extra information.


announce_peers
''''''''''''''

The syntax of the announce_peers request and reply are unchanged.  This
implies that an announce_peers request sent over IPv4 may only advertise an
IPv4 address, and an announce_peers request sent over IPv6 may only
advertise an IPv6 address.
