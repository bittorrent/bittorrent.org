<h1>Abstract</h1>
<p>This BEP aims to provide recommendations for BitTorrent clients using proxies
for the purpose of obfuscating the origin of its traffic. It primarily focuses
on ways to inadvertantly leak information that could aid an adversary in discovering
the origin.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="setup">
<h1>Setup</h1>
<p>For the purposes of this BEP, the assumption is that the user of the bittorrent
client attempts to remain anonymous. This is attempted by by configuring the
client to use a proxy, running on a 3rd party machine, or running over <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tor.org">Tor</a>.</p>
<p>This use case is especially important when BitTorrent is being used to distribute
sensitive information where the originator or anyone participating in the swarm
may risk reprisals. Such anonymity is critical where political and religious
speech is threatened.</p>
<p>It is the author's hope that this document will be updated as new potential
information leaks of the BitTorrent protocol are discovered.</p>
<p>Thie BEP essentially describes the semantics of the <tt class="docutils literal">anonymous_mode</tt> settings
in <a class="reference external" href="www.utorrent.com">uTorrent</a> and <a class="reference external" href="www.libtorrent.org">libtorrent</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="information-leaks">
<h1>Information leaks</h1>
<p>One way for an attacker to identify the true origin of a bittorrent client
using a proxy is to look for hints in the data the client is sending. This
could include anything from the specific version of software is being used,
the peer ID that's advertized to listen port numbers.</p>
<p>This section will cover specific pieces of the BitTorrent protocol that could
be used in such attacks, that client authors may want to restrict when using
proxies.</p>
<p>Each sub section has a recommended mitigation. It is meant to be applied only
in scenarios where the user is attempting to remain anonymous. Which using a proxy
may be a good indicator of.</p>
<div class="section" id="software-version">
<h2>software version</h2>
<p>BitTorrent client often encode what software its running in the peer ID
advertised in the BitTorrent handshake (see <a class="reference external" href="bep_0020.html">BEP20</a>). It's also commonly exchanged as
part of the extended handshake (see <a class="reference external" href="bep_0010.html">BEP10</a>), where a free-form string
representation of the client name and version is exchanged.</p>
<p>If the client, or the specific version of it, the user is running is rare,
an attacker may use that to narrow down the set of potential users that may
be on the other end of a certain peer connection.</p>
<p>For instance, it's possible that the orignal download of the client, or
auto-updates of the client do not happen over an anonymized network. Hence,
it cannot be ruled out that an adversary can eaves drop on who downloaded
which version of the software.</p>
<p><em>uTorrent includes its build number in the version advertises in the peer ID,
making it more unique.</em></p>
<p><em>uTorrent does not use proxy settings when checking for auto-updates and
downloading new versions, because it's considered a risk to fail updates.</em></p>
<p>The recommendation is to <strong>not</strong> send the <tt class="docutils literal">&quot;v&quot;</tt> key in the extended handshake
and to not encode client version in the peer ID.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="peer-id">
<h2>peer ID</h2>
<p>The peer ID as a 20 byte identifier which is supposed to be unique to a
specific BitTorrent peer. This ID was thought to be useful when the protocol
was designed, but turned out to be redundant and is typically not used for
anything other than detecting whether a client connected to itself.</p>
<p>The BitTorrent specification (<a class="reference external" href="bep_0003.html">BEP3</a>) indicates that the peer ID is persistent
throughout the dowload of one torrent. In practice, it is common for clients
to generate a single peer ID and use it for all torrents. The peer ID may even
be persisted across sessions.</p>
<p>Using the same peer ID on multiple swarms leaks information about participation
in other swarms. The adversary could correlate a peer ID to other swarms. This
exposes the risk that one of those swarms may at some point be joind without
the proxy running, and the user's true IP is given out. An adversary could also
narrow down its possibilities by simply analyzing which other swarms the victim
participates in.</p>
<p>Simply analyzing swarms may narrow down locale and cultural associations, with
other content.</p>
<p>The recommendation is to always send a random peer ID, to both trackers and other
peers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="ip-and-port-in-extended-handshake">
<h2>IP and port in extended handshake</h2>
<p>As part of the extended handshake, some clients advertise their listen port and
alternative IP address. The purpose of this it to let the other end be able
to connect back if the connection is broken for some reason.</p>
<p>The alternative IP is typically and IPv6 address, when connecting over IPv4
and vice versa. (See <a class="reference external" href="bep_0010.html">BEP10</a>).</p>
<p>Clearly sending the actual IP address as part of the message gives away the
user. It's also important to note that the port (<tt class="docutils literal">p</tt>) could pose a threat
if it is persistent (<a class="reference internal" href="#listen-port">listen port</a>).</p>
<p>The recommendation is to never send <tt class="docutils literal">ipv4</tt> and the <tt class="docutils literal">ipv6</tt> fields in the
extended header. Don't send <tt class="docutils literal">p</tt> unless it refers to the proxy's listen port.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="listen-port">
<h2>listen port</h2>
<p>A popular feature among clients is to generate a random port on first start,
and then save that port for using in subsequent sessions.</p>
<p>This poses a similar threat as a persistent peer ID. The port space typically
used is the upper 10 or 20 thousand ports or so. This makes the port picked
by your client fairly unique. If the same port is used consistently, the same
kinds of correlations can be made as with the <a class="reference internal" href="#peer-id">peer ID</a>.</p>
<p>The recommendation is to generate a new random listen port for every session.
Don't advertise your listen port in the extended handshake, unless it refers
to the listen port on the proxy. The listen port used on the proxy should
be randomized on every startup.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="dht-port">
<h2>DHT port</h2>
<p>As part of the BitTorrent extension to support DHT, peers send a <tt class="docutils literal">dht port</tt>-
message after handshake, to inform the other peer that it is participating
in the DHT on the specified port.</p>
<p>The DHT typically uses the same port as the bittorrent engine's listen port.
The DHT listen port can provide similar correlations as the bittorent
engine's <a class="reference internal" href="#listen-port">listen port</a>.</p>
<p>The recommendation is to not send the DHT listen port message, unless
it refers to the listen port opened on the proxy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tracker-ip-argument">
<h2>tracker IP argument</h2>
<p>Some clients supports an extension to the HTTP tracker protocol involving
sending <tt class="docutils literal">&amp;ipv4=</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">&amp;ipv6=</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">&amp;ip=</tt> arguments. These intend to
work as hints for the tracker in order to more easily connect IPv4 and IPv6
peers on the same swarm.</p>
<p>The <tt class="docutils literal">&amp;ip=</tt> argument is not specific to HTTP trackers, but exist on UDP
trackers as well. These fields could concievably be used by and adversary to
find the true IP address of the client.</p>
<p>The recommendation is to never send either of <tt class="docutils literal">&amp;ip=</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">&amp;IPv4=</tt> or
<tt class="docutils literal">&amp;IPv6=</tt> to any tracker, and to not send the <tt class="docutils literal">ip</tt> field to UDP trackers.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="unsupported-proxy-protocols">
<h2>unsupported proxy protocols</h2>
<p>When using a proxy, it is very common for the proxy to only support
a limited subset of types of traffic. For instance, an HTTP
tracker may only support HTTP requests, and will never support UDP
circuits. They may support arbitrary TCP via the CONNECT method.</p>
<p>The SOCKS5 protocol supports UDP and incoming connections, but most
popular implementations have no to poor support of these features.</p>
<p>It is important that the client never circumvents the proxy for traffic
that otherwise would not be supported. If the user has indicated
it would like to remain anonymous, not working is better than leaking
information.</p>
<p>The recommendation is to simply drop all UDP traffic when using an
HTTP or SOCKS4 proxy. UDP trackers, DHT and uTP will simply not work.
Attempt to accept incoming connections over SOCKS5, but expect it to
fail. Don't fall back to accepting connections locally. Attempt
to set up a UDP tunnel with SOCKS5, but expect to fail.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="incoming-connections">
<h2>incoming connections</h2>
<p>When routing all traffic through a proxy, a client may still accept
incoming connections from other peers (it's just that no peer would
know about its IP).</p>
<p>An adversary may try to connect to the client on its public IP however.
For instance, if the adversary can limit the possible IPs the victim
is behind to some reasonably small number, all of them could simply be
contacted until the victim computer is found.</p>
<p>The recommendation, don't accept incoming connections other than via the
proxy. If incoming connections are supported at all, it's likely a SOCKS5
proxy and all incoming connections are actually initiated as outgoing
ones. In such case, there is no need for a listen socket at all.
Don't accept any DHT packets, unless it comes from the proxy.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="local-peer-discovery">
<h2>Local peer discovery</h2>
<p>Local peer discovery involves joining a multi-cast group and advertising
which torrents one is interested in or seeding.</p>
<p>IP multicast does not have an inherent restriction to not leave an
internet subscriber's home. There are networks where multicast is
allowed across an entire campus for instance. Broadcasting which torrents
one is downloading to an undefined, and potentially large set of computers
is risky.</p>
<p>The recommendation is to disable local peer discovery.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="port-forwarding">
<h2>port forwarding</h2>
<p>Even if incoming connections are rejected, an adversary may be able to
tell whether a certain port is open on a router and closed on the internal
computer. For example by examining the ICMP response from trying to contact
the open port and a port that is assumed to be closed. The computer running
the client may behave differently from the NAT. There may also be an opportunity
for identifying differences in timing of the responses.</p>
<p>An adversary could use such technique by pinning a specific <a class="reference internal" href="#listen-port">listen port</a>
to a specific (or a small number) of IPs.</p>
<p>The recommendation is to not forward any ports, since it's not necessary anyway.</p>
