<p>BitTorrent is a protocol for distributing files. It identifies content
by URL and is designed to integrate seamlessly with the web. Its
advantage over plain HTTP is that when multiple downloads of the same
file happen concurrently, the downloaders upload to each other, making
it possible for the file source to support very large numbers of
downloaders with only a modest increase in its load.</p>
<div class="section" id="a-bittorrent-file-distribution-consists-of-these-entities">
<h1>A BitTorrent file distribution consists of these entities:</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>An ordinary web server</li>

<li>A BitTorrent tracker</li>
<li>An 'original' downloader</li>
<li>The end user web browsers</li>
<li>The end user downloaders</li>

<li>Start running a tracker (or, more likely, have one running already).</li>
<li>Start running an ordinary web server, such as apache, or have one already.</li>
<li>Associate the extension .torrent with mimetype application/x-bittorrent on their web server (or have done so already).</li>
<li>Generate a metainfo (.torrent) file using the complete file to be served and the URL of the tracker.</li>
<li>Put the metainfo file on the web server.</li>

<h1>bencoding</h1>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Strings are length-prefixed base ten followed by a colon and the string.
For example <tt class="docutils literal">4:spam</tt> corresponds to 'spam'.</li>
<li>Integers are represented by an 'i' followed by the number in base 10
followed by an 'e'. For example <tt class="docutils literal">i3e</tt> corresponds to 3 and
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">i-3e</span></tt> corresponds to -3. Integers have no size
limitation. <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">i-0e</span></tt> is invalid. All encodings with a leading

<li>Lists are encoded as an 'l' followed by their elements (also
bencoded) followed by an 'e'. For example <tt class="docutils literal">l4:spam4:eggse</tt>
corresponds to ['spam', 'eggs'].</li>
<li>Dictionaries are encoded as a 'd' followed by a list of alternating
keys and their corresponding values followed by an 'e'. For example,
<tt class="docutils literal">d3:cow3:moo4:spam4:eggse</tt> corresponds to {'cow': 'moo',
'spam': 'eggs'} and <tt class="docutils literal">d4:spaml1:a1:bee</tt> corresponds to
{'spam': ['a', 'b']}. Keys must be strings and appear in sorted order

<p>Note that in the context of bencoding strings including dictionary keys
are arbitrary byte sequences (<tt class="docutils literal">uint8_t[]</tt>).</p>
<p>BEP authors are encouraged to use ASCII-compatible strings for dictionary keys
and UTF-8 for human-readable data. Implementations must not rely on this.</p>

<div class="section" id="metainfo-files">
<h1>metainfo files</h1>
<p>Metainfo files (also known as .torrent files) are bencoded dictionaries
with the following keys:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>announce</dt>
<dd>The URL of the tracker.</dd>
<dt>info</dt>
<dd>This maps to a dictionary, with keys described below.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">piece layers</tt></dt>
<dd><p class="first">A dictionary of strings. For each file in the file tree that is larger than the piece size
it contains one string value.
The keys are the merkle roots while the values consist of concatenated hashes
of one layer within that merkle tree.
The layer is chosen so that one hash covers <tt class="docutils literal">piece length</tt> bytes.
For example if the piece size is 16KiB then the leaf hashes are used.
If a piece size of 128KiB is used then 3rd layer up from the leaf hashes is used.
Layer hashes which exclusively cover data beyond the end of file,
i.e. are only needed to balance the tree, are omitted.
All hashes are stored in their binary format.</p>
<p class="last">A torrent is not valid if this field is absent, the contained hashes do not match
the merkle roots or are not from the correct layer.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
<p>All strings in a .torrent file defined by this BEP that contain human-readable text
are UTF-8 encoded.</p>

<dd>An integer value, set to 2 to indicate compatibility with the current revision of this

Future revisions will only increment this value to indicate an incompatible
change has been made, for example that hash algorithms were changed due to newly discovered

is of a newer version than they can handle before performing other validations which may
result in more general messages about invalid files.</dd>
<dt><tt class="docutils literal">file tree</tt></dt>
<dd><p class="first">A tree of dictionaries where dictionary keys represent UTF-8 encoded path elements.
Entries with zero-length keys describe the properties of the composed path at that point.
'UTF-8 encoded' in this context only means that if the native encoding is known at creation
time it must be converted to UTF-8.
Keys may contain invalid UTF-8 sequences or characters and names that are reserved on
specific  filesystems. Implementations must be prepared to sanitize them.
On most platforms path components exactly matching '.' and '..' must be sanitized
since they could lead to directory traversal  attacks and conflicting path descriptions.
On platforms that require valid UTF-8 path components this sanitizing step must happen
after normalizing overlong UTF-8 encodings.</p>

<h1>infohash</h1>
<p>The infohash is calculated by applying a hash function to the bencoded form of the info dictionary,
which is a substring of the metainfo file. For <tt class="docutils literal">meta version</tt> 2 SHA2-256 is used.</p>
<p>The info-hash must be the hash of the encoded form as found
in the .torrent file, which is identical to bdecoding the metainfo file,
extracting the info dictionary and encoding it <em>if and only if</em> the
bdecoder fully validated the input (e.g. key ordering, absence of leading zeros).
Conversely that means implementations must either reject invalid metainfo files
or extract the substring directly.
They must not perform a decode-encode roundtrip on invalid data.</p>
<p>For some uses as torrent identifier it is truncated to 20 bytes.</p>
<p>When verifying an infohash implementations must also check that the <tt class="docutils literal">piece layers</tt>
hashes outside the info dictionary match the <tt class="docutils literal">pieces root</tt> fields.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="trackers">
<h1>trackers</h1>
<p>Tracker GET requests have the following keys:</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>info_hash</dt>
<dd>The 20byte truncated infohash as described above.
This value will almost certainly have to be escaped.</dd>
<dt>peer_id</dt>
<dd>A string of length 20 which this downloader uses as its id. Each
downloader generates its own id at random at the start of a new
download. This value will also almost certainly have to be escaped.</dd>
<dt>ip</dt>
<dd>An optional parameter giving the IP (or dns name) which this peer is
at. Generally used for the origin if it's on the same machine as the
tracker.</dd>
<dt>port</dt>
<dd>The port number this peer is listening on. Common behavior is for a
downloader to try to listen on port 6881 and if that port is taken try
6882, then 6883, etc. and give up after 6889.</dd>
<dt>uploaded</dt>
<dd>The total amount uploaded so far, encoded in base ten ascii.</dd>
<dt>downloaded</dt>
<dd>The total amount downloaded so far, encoded in base ten ascii.</dd>
<dt>left</dt>
<dd>The number of bytes this peer still has to download, encoded in
base ten ascii. Note that this can't be computed from downloaded and
the file length since it might be a resume, and there's a chance that
some of the downloaded data failed an integrity check and had to be
re-downloaded.</dd>
<dt>event</dt>
<dd>This is an optional key which maps to <tt class="docutils literal">started</tt>,
<tt class="docutils literal">completed</tt>, or <tt class="docutils literal">stopped</tt> (or
<tt class="docutils literal">empty</tt>, which is the same as not being present). If not
present, this is one of the announcements done at regular
intervals. An announcement using <tt class="docutils literal">started</tt> is sent when a
download first begins, and one using <tt class="docutils literal">completed</tt> is sent
when the download is complete. No <tt class="docutils literal">completed</tt> is sent if
the file was complete when started. Downloaders send an announcement
using <tt class="docutils literal">stopped</tt> when they cease downloading.</dd>
</dl>
<p>Tracker responses are bencoded dictionaries. If a tracker response
has a key <tt class="docutils literal">failure reason</tt>, then that maps to a human
readable string which explains why the query failed, and no other keys
are required. Otherwise, it must have two keys: <tt class="docutils literal">interval</tt>,
which maps to the number of seconds the downloader should wait between
regular rerequests, and <tt class="docutils literal">peers</tt>. <tt class="docutils literal">peers</tt> maps to
a list of dictionaries corresponding to <tt class="docutils literal">peers</tt>, each of
which contains the keys <tt class="docutils literal">peer id</tt>, <tt class="docutils literal">ip</tt>, and
<tt class="docutils literal">port</tt>, which map to the peer's self-selected ID, IP
address or dns name as a string, and port number, respectively. Note
that downloaders may rerequest on nonscheduled times if an event
happens or they need more peers.</p>
<p>More commonly is that trackers return a compact representation of
the peer list, see <a class="reference external" href="bep_0023.html">BEP 23</a> and <a class="reference external" href="bep_0007.html">BEP 7</a>.</p>
<p>If you want to make any extensions to metainfo files or tracker
queries, please coordinate with Bram Cohen to make sure that all
extensions are done compatibly.</p>
<p>It is common to announce over a <a class="reference external" href="bep_0015.html">UDP tracker protocol</a> as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="peer-protocol">
<h1>peer protocol</h1>
<p>BitTorrent's peer protocol operates over TCP or <a class="reference external" href="bep_0029.html">uTP</a>.</p>
<p>Peer connections are symmetrical. Messages sent in both directions
look the same, and data can flow in either direction.</p>
<p>The peer protocol refers to pieces of the file by index as
described in the metainfo file, starting at zero. When a peer finishes
downloading a piece and checks that the hash matches, it announces
that it has that piece to all of its peers.</p>
<p>Connections contain two bits of state on either end: choked or not,
and interested or not. Choking is a notification that no data will be
sent until unchoking happens. The reasoning and common techniques
behind choking are explained later in this document.</p>
<p>Data transfer takes place whenever one side is interested and the
other side is not choking. Interest state must be kept up to date at
all times - whenever a downloader doesn't have something they
currently would ask a peer for in unchoked, they must express lack of
interest, despite being choked. Implementing this properly is tricky,
but makes it possible for downloaders to know which peers will start
downloading immediately if unchoked.</p>
<p>Connections start out choked and not interested.</p>
<p>When data is being transferred, downloaders should keep several
piece requests queued up at once in order to get good TCP performance
(this is called 'pipelining'.) On the other side, requests which can't
be written out to the TCP buffer immediately should be queued up in
memory rather than kept in an application-level network buffer, so
they can all be thrown out when a choke happens.</p>
<p>The peer wire protocol consists of a handshake followed by a
never-ending stream of length-prefixed messages. The handshake starts
with character nineteen (decimal) followed by the string 'BitTorrent
protocol'. The leading character is a length prefix, put there in the
hope that other new protocols may do the same and thus be trivially
distinguishable from each other.</p>
<p>All later integers sent in the protocol are encoded as four bytes
big-endian.</p>
<p>After the fixed headers come eight reserved bytes, which are all
zero in all current implementations. If you wish to extend the
protocol using these bytes, please coordinate with Bram Cohen to make
sure all extensions are done compatibly.</p>
<p>Next comes the 20 byte truncated infohash. If both sides don't send the same value,
they sever the connection. The one possible exception is if a downloader
wants to do multiple downloads over a single port, they may wait for
incoming connections to give a download hash first, and respond with
the same one if it's in their list.</p>
<p>After the download hash comes the 20-byte peer id which is reported
in tracker requests and contained in peer lists in tracker
responses. If the receiving side's peer id doesn't match the one the
initiating side expects, it severs the connection.</p>
<p>That's it for handshaking, next comes an alternating stream of
length prefixes and messages. Messages of length zero are keepalives,
and ignored. Keepalives are generally sent once every two minutes, but
note that timeouts can be done much more quickly when data is
expected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="peer-messages">
<h1>peer messages</h1>
<p>All non-keepalive messages start with a single byte which gives their type.</p>
<p>The possible values are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>0 - choke</li>
<li>1 - unchoke</li>
<li>2 - interested</li>
<li>3 - not interested</li>
<li>4 - have</li>
<li>5 - bitfield</li>
<li>6 - request</li>
<li>7 - piece</li>
<li>8 - cancel</li>
<li>16 - reject</li>
<li>21 - hash request</li>
<li>22 - hashes</li>
<li>23 - hash reject</li>
</ul>
<p>'choke', 'unchoke', 'interested', and 'not interested' have no payload.</p>
<p>'bitfield' is only ever sent as the first message. Its payload is a
bitfield with each index that downloader has sent set to one and the
rest set to zero. Downloaders which don't have anything yet may skip
the 'bitfield' message. The first byte of the bitfield corresponds to
indices 0 - 7 from high bit to low bit, respectively. The next one
8-15, etc. Spare bits at the end are set to zero.</p>
<p>The 'have' message's payload is a single number, the index which
that downloader just completed and checked the hash of.</p>
<p>'hash request' messages contain a pieces root, base layer, index, length,
and proof layers. The pieces root is the root hash of a file.
The base layer defines the lowest requested layer of the
hash tree. It is the number of layers above the leaf layer that the hash list
should start at. A value of zero indicates that leaf hashes are
requested. Clients are only required to support setting the base layer
to the leaf and piece layers. Index is the offset in hashes
of the first requested hash in the base layer.
Index MUST be a multiple of length, this includes zero.
Length is the number of hashes to include from the base layer.
Length MUST be equal-to-or-greater-than two and a power of two.
Length SHOULD NOT be greater than 512. Proof layers is the
number of ancestor layers to include. Note that the limits imposed on
index and length above mean that at-most one uncle hash is needed
from each proof layer.
Hash requests MUST be answered with either a 'hashes' or 'hash reject' message.</p>
<p>Clients must be able to service requests for hash blocks covering pieces which they
have announced through bitfield or have messages. They may be able to service
additional requests if they have access to the full layers from a metadata file
but requesting implementations should try to prioritize requests where they can be certain
that the other party can must have the necessary data.</p>
<p>Hash requests may be sent to a peer regardless of its choke state.
For unchoked peers, hash requests should be subject to the same rate
limiting policy as piece requests, except that all hash requests are not
necessarily rejected after a peer is choked. Clients may impose a separate
rate limit on hash requests received from choked peers.
Clients MUST NOT reject a hash request with a base layer of zero if it
immediately follows a request for one of the chunks in the requested range
and the client services the chunk request with a piece message.</p>
<p>'hashes' messages contain a pieces root, base layer, index, length,
proof layers, and hashes. This message MUST correlate with a 'hash request'
message. Hashes starts with the base layer and ends with the uncle hash
closest to the root. A proof layer is omitted if the requested hashes
include the entire child layer. In other words, the first log2(length)-1
proof layers are ommitted. The ommitted layers are still counted towards
the requested proof layers.</p>
<p>'hash reject' messages have the same payload as 'hash request' messages.
They indicate that a peer will not service a hash request.</p>
<p>'request' messages contain an index, begin, and length. The last
two are byte offsets. Length is generally a power of two unless it
gets truncated by the end of a file. All current implementations use
2^14 (16 kiB), and close connections which request an amount greater than
that.</p>
<p>'cancel' messages have the same payload as request messages. They
are generally only sent towards the end of a download, during what's
called 'endgame mode'. When a download is almost complete, there's a
tendency for the last few pieces to all be downloaded off a single
hosed modem line, taking a very long time. To make sure the last few
pieces come in quickly, once requests for all pieces a given
downloader doesn't have yet are currently pending, it sends requests
for everything to everyone it's downloading from. To keep this from
becoming horribly inefficient, it sends cancels to everyone else every
time a piece arrives.
cancel messages do not relieve the other side from the duty of responding
to a request. They must either send a piece or a reject message as response.</p>
<p>'reject' messages have the  same payload as request messages. They
indicate that a peer will not service a request. They must
be sent after a choke message to cancel all pending requests.</p>
<p>'piece' messages contain an index, begin, and piece. Note that they
are correlated with request messages must be explicitly rejected
by the remote after an unchoke. This means a request is answered
with either a piece or reject messages. If an unsolicited piece
is received a peer MUST close the connection.</p>
<p>Downloaders generally download pieces in random order, which does a
reasonably good job of keeping them from having a strict subset or
superset of the pieces of any of their peers.</p>
<p>Choking is done for several reasons. TCP congestion control behaves
very poorly when sending over many connections at once. Also, choking
lets each peer use a tit-for-tat-ish algorithm to ensure that they get
a consistent download rate.</p>
<p>The choking algorithm described below is the currently deployed
one. It is very important that all new algorithms work well both in a
network consisting entirely of themselves and in a network consisting
mostly of this one.</p>
<p>There are several criteria a good choking algorithm should meet. It
should cap the number of simultaneous uploads for good TCP
performance. It should avoid choking and unchoking quickly, known as
'fibrillation'. It should reciprocate to peers who let it
download. Finally, it should try out unused connections once in a
while to find out if they might be better than the currently used
ones, known as optimistic unchoking.</p>
<p>The currently deployed choking algorithm avoids fibrillation by
only changing who's choked once every ten seconds. It does
reciprocation and number of uploads capping by unchoking the four
peers which it has the best download rates from and are
interested. Peers which have a better upload rate but aren't
interested get unchoked and if they become interested the worst
uploader gets choked. If a downloader has a complete file, it uses its
upload rate rather than its download rate to decide who to
unchoke.</p>
<p>For optimistic unchoking, at any one time there is a single peer
which is unchoked regardless of its upload rate (if interested, it
counts as one of the four allowed downloaders.) Which peer is
optimistically unchoked rotates every 30 seconds. To give them a
decent chance of getting a complete piece to upload, new connections
are three times as likely to start as the current optimistic unchoke
as anywhere else in the rotation.</p>
<p>Note that the original version of the peer protocol had no reject message.
That message has been adopted from the <a class="reference external" href="bep_0006.html">Fast Extension</a> which specifies
further optional messages.</p>

<h1>Upgrade Path</h1>
<p>For interoperability with BEP 3 a torrent can be created to contain the necessary
data for both formats. To do so the 'pieces' field and 'files' or 'length' in the info
dictionary must be generated to describe the same data in the same order.
Since the old format did not align files to piece boundaries a multifile torrent
must use BEP 47 padding files to achieve identical alignment.</p>
<p>Implementations supporting both formats can join both swarms by calculating
the new and old infohashes and downloading them to the same storage. Before
doing so they must validate that the content (file names, order, piece alignment)
is identical. During the download they must also verify that pieces match both piece
hash formats. If any inconsistency is detected they may either abort or fall back to
downloading one of the two formats as if the other were not present.</p>
<p>Implementations supporting both formats which joined both swarms of a hybrid torrent
MUST announce by making two requests (one for each swarm/<tt class="docutils literal">info_hash</tt>). For each request
the <tt class="docutils literal">downloaded</tt> and <tt class="docutils literal">uploaded</tt> parameters MUST contain the sum amount
that was respectively done in both swarms together.</p>
<p>When initiating a connection and sending the sha1 infohash of such a hybrid torrent
a peer can set the 4th most significant bit in the last byte of the reserved bitfield
to indicate that it also supports the new format. The remote peer may then respond
with the new infohash to upgrade the connect to the new format.</p>
